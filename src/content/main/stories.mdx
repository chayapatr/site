My name is Chayapatr (or Pub, for short). I'm an interdisciplinary maker and creative technologist based in Bangkok, Thailand. Welcome to my site!

## Exploring Connectivities

Since 2021, I have worked as a curator for [Creatorsgarten](https://creatorsgarten), an initiative I co-founded to accelerate the growth of maker culture in Thailand by connecting communities through meaningful gatherings and projects. With more than thousands of active members and tenth of community partners from different areas, we seek to make creativity and creation more accessible for all.

I also work as editor-in-chief at [Spaceth.co](https://spaceth.co), a media focused on science and space exploration in Thaialnd with 500,000 followers. Through the media and collaborations with partners both in public and private sectors, I seek to raise awareness about importance of science and advocate the democratize of space in Thailand and Southeast Asia.

In a more personal side, I do coding (mostly in JavaScript -- for applied computing), working on art and civic projects, exploring [lingustics](/ling), contemporary philosophy, digital humanities, and more.

Through these experinces, I aim to explore the dynamics and aspects of meaningful connectivities between humans, communities, and machines.
