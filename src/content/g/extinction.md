### Why Extinction? or Human Extinction as a Method

Our position on the brink of extinction is deliberately mentioned and discussed. Nevertheless, when we zoom out to the bigger picture, human extinction is inevitable, whether it happens in the next century or just a moment before [the end of everything (astrologically speaking)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIHKUB0QmA4). It is definitely not to discourage the current narrative to prevent us from our own-made disaster but to explore the underlying ideas and structure of the event.

But why? Regarding the effect of humans' perception of the future projected into present-day thoughts, I argue that the concept of optimal extinction for humanity and our choice to "design" it can shape how we interconnect with surrounding ecosystems.

**Further thoughts**: [Who control the future control the past](/g/control)

From that, the focus should not be on how to avoid it, but rather to decide, or to be more precise, "design" the method to go towards the desirable scenarios. **Or, in other words, to perceive human extinction as a method (in a philosophical sense of method toward some goal) instead of an inert possible scenario.**

### Humanistic Design for Nature

Daisy Ginsberg's ["Design for the Sixth Extinction"](https://www.daisyginsberg.com/work/designing-for-the-sixth-extinction) investigates the idea of disrupting the sixth extinction by human intervention through synthetic biology. The conceptual note mentions the convergences and divergence of two interests in biodiversity, from ecologists with conservationists and synthetic biologists. The battle in ideas between the two can be perceived as two designers arguing about the "better" design for extinctions and conservations, ultimately leading to our own extinction.

Lives intervene with nature, although they vary in scale: one animal consumes or endangers another, an alien species exists, and five mass extinctions happened before the emergence of humanity. As exhibited in Daisy Ginsberg's work, it is not to avoid the intervention but to design ["better"](https://www.daisyginsberg.com/work/better) interventions.

### The "Re" in "Redesign"?

Why are we redesigning the extinction and not just "design?" Logistically, design always emerged, even unintentionally; even in the inaction, it can be perceived that this is the design we chose for the event.

However, a "redesign" requires careful thought and retrospection on such a subject, such as a redesign of a brand or a campaign. Even if minor, retrospectives come into account. That's a reason to emphasize "re" in "redesign" and to ponder how we can redesign the human extinction.
