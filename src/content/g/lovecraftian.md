title: Text Embedding, Complexity, and Lovecraftian Horror

The concept of Lovecraftian horror of being omniscient reflects a challenge akin to dealing with the complexities of postmodernism. It's like trying to navigate a world where everything is interconnected.

I have played with many text embedding models for the last several months. From my crude (and maybe wrong) observations, I've noticed that more advanced models, or those with larger datasets, tend to score more similarities between the pair of objects (e.g., king and queen, aliens and knight) than the smaller ones.

As the data pool grows, these models seem to uncover more intricate connections that simpler or smaller models might overlook.  When faced with a flood of information, the interconnections become overwhelming, making it hard to derive causation models for anything. May this be the real-world reflection of such horror?

The loss of identity also came to my interest; the more you know, the blurrier the concept of identity becomes. This raises an interesting question: how does an omniscient being differ from another with the same infinite knowledge and memories? In a world where everything is known, the notion of individuality becomes elusive, leaving us to ponder the true nature of self in the realm of omniscience.
