***Been thinking a lot lately about my next project. The main focus is on ecological systems and the overall concept of environmental issues. What can we develop from this?***

## Uninventing the Bomb?

There's a 1996 paper on JSTOR called ["Uninventing the Bomb?"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45355148) which, by the way, intrigues me a lot, dissecting the sociopolitical conditions concerning the nuclear bomb and highlighting the complex entanglement of its abolishment, as the author noted: the abolition of nuclear weapons should be approached as a process: we do not know, and should not pretend to know, the solution to all the problems it may throw up.

What interested me about this (although it can be argued that it is not that very original) is the emphasis on considering the complex system as a complex system and not a simple deterministic causality machine of some kind that can be formulated within one single formula.

From this (maybe as a nod to Raymond Carver,) **what (should) we talk about when we talk about (nature)?** I am on the line with modern-day post-constructivists (arguably, again) To go against reductivism and tackle it regarding its complexity, which is definitely even more complex than our socially constructed world.

## Better
I first knew Dr. Daisy Ginsberg from her contribution to the book "140 Artists' Ideas for Planet Earth," in which she wrote about making quadrats and pondering the interrelationship between self and surrounding nature.

In 2018, Dr. Daisy Ginsberg gave a talk called "Designing Nature" at the event The Conference 2018. She mentioned her thesis "Better," which inspects the notion of being "better," that is, “What is better?”, “Whose better?” and “Who decides?” because "better" takes the sides. From the work, she perceives the problem of how we imagine the future, or more specifically, the plurality of choices for the next step towards the possible future.

One key idea that strikes me is about the interrelation between points in time where not only does the past affect the present or the present affects the future, but it also works backward. This is definitely weird, considering the narrative from many: what we think about the future, for example, from her talk, ideas about what possibilities of human intervention with Mars affect the thoughts regarding the relationship between humankind and nature [[The Wilding of Mars](https://www.daisyginsberg.com/work/the-wilding-of-mars)].

## Orwell
"Who controls the past control the future; who controls the present control the past," wrote Orwell in his world-famous 1984. Two parts of the quote serve different points of view, for one analysis, with the first concerning the power position and the second about the creation of "imagine communities," as in the manner of Benedict Anderson's works.

The works by Anderson and many others depict the construction of narratives projected into the past. This is not an uncommon situation at all, as stories always carry some narratives. This is when we can say the present controls the past.

When we extend the notion of how we think about the future and who controls the grand vision of what the future should look like, as Dr. Daisy Ginsberg demonstrated through her Martian project, the design of Mars wilding can shape the perspective of how we intervene with environments, it can affect the narrative we imposed to the past as well.

This is when we can say who controls the future controls the past.

Back to Dr. Ginsberg's question from "better": "Who decides?" When we envision a palette of possibilities of what might be for the sake of a "better" future, there will definitely not exist a consensus. How might we tackle this grand problem?
